// ### Letter Reducer ####
// Write a method that takes a string that contains only 3 distinct
// characters - 'x', 'y', 'z' - and reduces it until it cannot be reduced
// any further.
//
// A string is reduced by replacing a pair of repeated characters with a
// single instance of the character that comes next in the limited
// alphabet:
//
// 'xx' is reduced to 'y'
// 'yy' is reduced to 'z'
// 'zz' is reduced to 'x'
//
// Reduce only one pair at a time. When there are multiple pairs that can
// be reduced, you should always reduce the left-most pair.
//
// Examples:
// letter_reducer('yxx') => 'yy' => 'z'
// letter_reducer('z') => 'z'
// letter_reducer('zzxxy') => 'xxxy' => 'yxy'
